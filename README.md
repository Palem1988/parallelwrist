LIMS2-AMBIDEX wrist principle - the contact of two rolling spheres

(btw. this is also the basic mechanism behind all Delta printers,
but usually with ball-joints instead of 2DOF passive joints,
old, printable carriages were using something similar)

M3 stock screws (4.5mm holes for them to turn freely)

no bearings, so very crude, but printable without supports
